# 🎮 FunFlips: A Memory-Based Learning Game for Kids (Ages 4–6)

Welcome to **FunFlips** — a fun, educational 2D game developed using the Godot engine. This group project was created in our 2nd semester as part of our foundation of software engineering course. The aim is to foster early childhood learning through play, teamwork, and hands-on software development.

## 🧠 Game Concept

**FunFlips** is a memory card game designed to help children aged 4–6 improve their:
- **Memory**
- **Concentration**
- **Vocabulary**

Players flip cards to find matching pairs. Each match is paired with audio pronunciation, blending **visual** and **audio** learning for maximum engagement.

## 🎯 Learning Categories

Three themed categories are available:
- 🐾 **Animals**
- 🍎 **Fruits**
- 🥦 **Vegetables**

Each category offers three levels of difficulty:
- **Easy:** 12 cards (6 pairs)
- **Medium:** 18 cards (9 pairs)
- **Hard:** 24 cards (12 pairs)
